## About the IGS Polls
Between April 16 and 20, 2020 the [Institute of Governmental Studies (IGS)](https://www.igs.berkeley.edu), in conjunction with the [California Institute of Health Equity and Action(Cal-IHEA)](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/research/centers/california-initiative-for-health-equity-action), polled 8,800 registered voters about a variety of issues concerning the current state of politics and COVID-19.  This was an unprecendented and urgently needed pulse-taking of the California populace during the pandemic. 

Below we provide an overview of the IGS Poll and describe how key findings from this survey can be found in the **IGS Poll Reports** while the data itself is made available by the **D-Lab**.

We then provide a short tutorial on how to access and explore the IGS Poll data in Python.
