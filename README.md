### About The Berkeley IGS Poll

The [Berkeley IGS Poll](https://www.igs.berkeley.edu/research/berkeley-igs-poll) is a periodic survey of California public opinion on important matters of politics, public policy, and public issues. The poll, which is disseminated widely, seeks to provide a broad measure of contemporary public opinion, and to generate data for subsequent scholarly analysis. IGS Polls have been distributed 2-4 times per year since 2015. 

The IGS Polls continue the tradition of the California Field Polls. The Field Poll, or the California Poll, was established in 1947 by [Mervin Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervin_Field) and operated continuously as an independent, non-partisan, media-sponsored public opinion news service from 1946 - 2014. Prior to their discontinuation, IGS collaborated with the Field Poll on a number of polls in 2011 and 2012.

### Berkeley IGS Poll Reports
IGS researchers analyze the reponses from each survey and publish summary reports of key findings. Typically many reports are produced per survey. Recent IGS Poll reports can be downloaded from [eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/uc/igs_poll). You can stay abreast of new IGS Polls and reports by using the form on the IGS website to join the [IGS mailing list](https://www.igs.berkeley.edu/about).


### Accessing the Berkeley IGS and Field Poll Data
The [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu) makes the IGS and Field Poll data available via [SDA](https://sda.berkeley.edu/). SDA, or `Survey Documentation and Analysis` is an online tool for survey data analysis that also provides a platform for managing the survey data files and related documentation and facilitating their download. SDA was developed at UC, Berkeley but since 2015 it has been managed and supported by the Institute for Scientific Analysis (ISA), a private, non-profit organization, under agreement with the University of California.

A complete list of the IGS and Field polls that are accessible via SDA can be found on the [D-Lab Data California Polls webpage](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/data-resources/california-polls).
